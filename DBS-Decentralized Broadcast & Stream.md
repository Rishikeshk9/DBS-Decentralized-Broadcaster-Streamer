## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
Integrating Live Stream for Audius music Creators- Decentralized Broadcaster Streamer
There are various music creators on Audius, this is a decentralized platform for audio creators. 
This project focuses on live streaming, concerts for those music creators. It is a platform which allows user to create his/her live stream for which people have to get a pass to watch. 
We have implemented Unlock protocol such that users would need to pay a certain amount to our streaming platform so that they can get access to new content or concerts hosted by their favourite independent creators. 

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
The project uses Textile's Buckets to host the streaming site on the blockchain. We are going to implement NFT drops in the live stream where we would use IPFS to store the metadata.
